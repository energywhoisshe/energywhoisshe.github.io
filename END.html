  <p>I invite into this space bodies still/yet/unknowingly here and a bouquet of flowers bursting with life like a MAH-UHM beyond time [1]. With drafting paper, dak paper, mulberry paper, backing paper, and photographic paper, I prepared places from which to suspend these flowers. I recited Eon Hee, read Theresa, and installed an underground tunnel.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <p>February is a month of graduations. Both graduate schools and kindergartens hold graduation ceremonies. Flowers suck in water with their bodies cut at the root, as their passageways turn to pulp. The poet smells poetry from a bouquet of flowers. The dog barks early like an alarm clock every morning. The bed stands on all fours. The door, with its four corners, opens and closes. The bright yellow light from the window also has four corners to its shadow, but it falls diagonally as if italicized. Snow falls in spring, too.</p>
  <p>I first examined postmortem changes and damages, then specifically neonatal and pediatric deaths as well as deaths from sex crimes. Deaths from choking, drowning, addiction, and starvation followed. Even as I committed certain chapters to memory, small details would still appear from secluded windows. Some bodies I drew multiple times. Initially, I worried this was not fair to the others, but befriending someone means that their face draws closer than other faces. Given the small size of reference images in forensic books, I discovered new details each time I drew them. For example, what I thought was flesh turned out to be an eye, and a spine was in fact an umbilical cord. I felt a strange obligation to draw every page. As I obsessively took dictation of their deaths at all hours, sleep turned from a time of rest to that of spiritual connection. A deaf, blind white dog came to my doorstep, and as soon as I decided to take him under my care, I stopped suffering from sleep paralysis. The white fur of an orphaned albino boy begins to occupy my home. He naps emitting a white light that shines even in the pitch-dark corner of my studio. </p>
  <p>Not long ago, the reservoir of my body [2] overflowed. I had read an online article in Busan Ilbo [3] about a drawing series by Park Jahyun called Baegyang-daero Road [4] and went to see the exhibition. The series depicts a red light district, where the side doors appear closed but slowly open if you keep looking. Soon after entering the exhibition hall, my feet began to cramp. I stretched on my toes as if I were wearing high heels, but the buzzing sensation persisted as it rose from my calves to my thighs, even curling around my fingers. Now I’m getting sleep paralysis awake, I thought. These symptoms continued throughout the early spring—stiff fingers, rigid feet, mind trapped in paralysis—side effects I had previously only experienced while listening to Professor Yang Hyo-sil's lectures on feminist aesthetics. Sometimes I wish to not feel anything if my wrists and ankles must continue to be paralyzed like this. But those who appear invisible to me have always existed in place. I began to imagine their invisible forms of contact on my extremities. When my ankle throbs, does it mean that I shouldn't stand straight? When my fingers can’t grip a pen, does it mean that I shouldn't keep drawing a certain body? Or is someone grabbing hold of my hand for me to draw more clearly? I take medicine and hang on to the indoor climbing wall so that the soreness of my limbs surpasses the feeling of paralysis and the buzzing slowly sinks into the depths of my body.</p>
  <p>It’s said that eyes are the window to the soul. When eyes meet, the windows overlap and open into a side door, and when I close my eyes, I see a dream in which numerous gates line a closed street, and the abandoned landscape plays on a loop. Now I can hear a voice. Here, the voice is a kind of collage that speaks only through quotations. For example, while I was alternating between autopsy photos and crime scene photos to reference in a drawing, YouTube autoplay informed me that this particular incident involved a woman freezing her twins promptly after birth due to pregnancy denial. Soon after, while reading a poetry collection, I heard them whisper, ". . . At birth I found / Myself inside a fridge.”[5] Or I encountered a silvery voice reading the title of this exhibition in French: “Le bouquet est toujours là.” Frozen children are as solid as a stone totem. Being solid is different from being hard (dure). Soon, when my friends with soft (doux), runny (mou), pillowy (moelleux), and half-eaten[6] faces peer over me without any malice, I am electrocuted simply for brushing against an untouchable dimension. With this shock and sleep paralysis of care, I can share with them only the flesh of my dead father and the hours of a living daughter that is myself. If everything is indeed a matter of time, I have created a means to endure this period of dry heat, a means that emerges from rules learned from my interactions with the dead. I wait for everything to be eradicated neither too soon nor too late.

  <p>I have witnessed the deaths of my father, my grandfather, a dog, a sparrow, a pigeon, a snake, and a mouse, in addition to the deaths of countless cows, pigs, chicken, insects, trees, and flowers. Given how I can visualize accidents overheard on the taxi radio (as if I’ve seen them firsthand), this practice of taking dictation from open bodies seemingly functions as both a rumination and a rehearsal for all the deaths I have witnessed and will witness throughout my life. Perhaps it intimates the truth that the body sustaining trauma is drawn to other damaged bodies. These days I imagine passersby in two scenarios: first, the stranger having met their end, and second, the stranger writing poetry with an unknowable expression.</p>
